    <img src="riceAndSteak.jpg">
    <p>A simple dish containing rice and steak. Easy to do and really good to eat!</p>

    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
<ul>
<li> 1 ½ pounds round steak</li>
<li> 2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
<li> 1 (29 ounce) can diced tomatoes</li>
<li>1 medium green bell pepper</li>
<li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
<li>½ teaspoon ground ginger</li>
<li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
<li>4 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
<li>1 cube beef bouillon cube</li>
<li>2 cups warm water</li>
<li>2 cups hot cooked rice, or as needed</li>
</ul>


<h1>Steps</h1>

<ol>
    <li>
        Trim any fat from steak; thinly slice steak into 2- to 3-inch strips. Core and seed bell pepper, then thinly slice into 3-inch strips. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add steak and cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Add bell peppers; cook and stir until peppers start to soften and steak is browned, 3 to 5 minutes. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Reduce heat and add diced tomatoes, soy sauce, garlic powder, ginger, and black pepper. Cover and simmer for 10 minutes. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Stir cornstarch and bouillon cube into water; stir well until dissolved. Pour mixture into the skillet. Cover and simmer, stirring occasionally, until sauce thickens to a gravy-like consistency, about 10 minutes. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Remove from heat and serve over hot cooked rice. 
    </li>
</ol>
